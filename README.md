- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnnydtennessee
- 👀 I solved the Collatz Conjecture with "critical theory," which is ancient wisdom and theology.

- Then I got into Google Bard, Colab, and Github last week!
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code using Google Bard to change the world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on World Telecommunication and Information Society Day
- 📫 How to reach me ( https://www.facebook.com/CollatzGrowthFunction/ WhatsApp button there) 

  Two python codes so far:
  1) A faster sieve using Collatz logic to print prime numbers.
  2) (draft, testing: a very elegant prime number algorithm using Collatz logic.)

 Bard will have to teach me how to test these in Ubuntu:
  1)A sorting program in Rust.
  2)A number program in Go.

  Next: a bunch of unsolved problems. I'm watching others decode ancient stones with Collatz, tech revolutions everywhere so it is fun.

  Goals: publish Collatz proof and argument for ancient mathematics! Critical theory machine learning pedagogy and epistemeology! Dan Brown-style novel about Collatz in our culture.
